## Answers
### What’s the purpose/vision of ThreadPilot?

ThreadPilot is the new core insurance platform that sits in front of multiple legacy systems and provides a unified, modern API for channels and internal applications.

Its main vision of ThreadPilot is to:
- Decouple frontends and new services from tightly coupled legacy systems.
- Aggregate and normalize data about customers, vehicles, and insurances into a coherent domain model.
- Act as the central place for applying business rules (pricing, validation, enrichment) instead of spreading them across many old systems.
- Enable a gradual migration away from legacy by hiding them behind stable, versioned APIs.

You can phrase it as: “ThreadPilot is where we want all new development to happen; legacy systems are just data providers behind it.”
